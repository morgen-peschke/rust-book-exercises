Rust Book Scratch Project
=========================

This is a scratch repo for working through the [Rust Book (interactive version)](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html).

It's highly unlikely there will be much of interest to anyone not working through this book, and a reasonable chance that any experienced Rust developer reading this is going to take psychic damage.
